    <!-- Welcome Statement -->
    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>

    <h2>This is a comprehensive showcase of my achievements and endeavors. As I embark on the journey of career development, I recognize the significance of an accessible platform to present my professional profile.</h2>

    <!--Short paragraph-->
    <p> My website is an online space where I show off what I've done and learned. It's not just a boring resume; it's a cool place that gives hiring folks a real look into my school and work experiences. The main idea is to go beyond the basics and let people
        know the details of my projects and experiences. I want this site to always be updated with the latest info on my education, achievements, and ongoing projects. It's a way to stand out when I'm applying for jobs. Come check out my story, and let's
        connect!
