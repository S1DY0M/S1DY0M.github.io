     Hello, my name is Austin Barr. 
     I am a junior in information technology. 
     I was born in Alabama. There I lived with my parents, eleven siblings, and grandmother. 
     Once I turned sixteen, my family moved to Saint Joseph, Missouri. After high school, 
     I decided to attend Mizzou. I studied mechanical engineering in Air Force ROTC. 
     I dropped ROTC and switched my major to IT after my first year. 
     I got married and decided to pursue a family instead of the military. 
     I am obtaining four certificates and a minor in psychology. 
     I plan to pursue a career in computer science. I am applying for internships, 
     hoping to get some experience in the IT field. One of the top companies 
     I would like to work for is Walmart. My dream is to work in Bentonville at their home office. 
     I would start my own business and work for myself after working for a few years.
