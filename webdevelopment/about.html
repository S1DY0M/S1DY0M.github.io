        <!-- About You Paragraph -->
        <p>Hello, my name is Austin Barr. I am a junior in information technology. I was born in Alabama. There I lived with my parents, eleven siblings, and grandmother. Once I turned sixteen, my family moved to Saint Joseph, Missouri. After high school,
            I decided to attend Mizzou. I studied mechanical engineering in Air Force ROTC. I dropped ROTC and switched my major to IT after my first year. I got married and decided to pursue a family instead of the military. I am obtaining four certificates
            and a minor in psychology. I plan to pursue a career in computer science. I am applying for internships, hoping to get some experience in the IT field. One of the top companies I would like to work for is Walmart. My dream is to work in Bentonville
            at their home office. I would start my own business and work for myself after working for a few years. </p>
