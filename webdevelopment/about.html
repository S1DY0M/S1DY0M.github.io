    <p>
        Hello, my name is Austin Barr. I am a junior in information technology. 
        I was born in Alabama. There I lived with my parents, eleven siblings, 
        and grandmother. Once I turned sixteen, my family moved to Saint Joseph,
        Missouri. After high school, I decided to attend Mizzou. 
        I studied mechanical engineering in Air Force ROTC. 
        I dropped ROTC and switched my major to IT after my first year. 
        I got married and decided to pursue a family instead of the military. 
        I am obtaining four certificates and a minor in psychology. 
        I plan to pursue a career in computer science. I am applying for 
        internships, hoping to get some experience in the IT field. 
        One of the top companies I would like to work for is Walmart. 
        My dream is to work in Bentonville at their home office. 
        I would start my own business and work for myself after working 
        for a few years.
